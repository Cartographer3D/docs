# Software Configuration

The following plugin requires **Kalico or Klipper version 0.13 or later**.

It is recommended that you run this on a **Raspberry Pi** or a similar device with an **up-to-date operating system**.

Please note, there is a high likelihood that this will **not function correctly on modified forks of Klipper**, such as those supplied with **Sovol, Elegoo, or Creality printers**. If you are running of them I would recommend using the origianl plugin available [here](../../archive/classic-installation/klipper-configuration.md)
