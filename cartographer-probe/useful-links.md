### A Better Print\_Start Macro by jontek2

A better Print\_Start macro is a great resource to imporve your `print_start` macro, it is detailed, verl well documented.\
\
With this macro you will be able to pass variables such as print temps and chamber temps to your print\_start macro. By doing so you will be able to automatically start a heatsoak and customize your printer's behaviour. The heatsoak will start when you've sliced a print with a bed temp higher than 90c. It will then heatsoak to your set chamber temp. If no chamber temp is set it will fall back to the macro's standard chamber temp of 40c. \
