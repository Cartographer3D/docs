# Switching between CAN and USB Operation (v3 only)

Switching your probe between USB and CAN modes, simply, requires you to reflash the firmware suitable for the mode of operation you wish to use.&#x20;

When doing this, it is VITAL that you flash not only the Cartographer Firmware, but also the modified Katapult bootloader as well.&#x20;

My recommendation would be for you to do this via your computer, using the STM32CubeProgrammer, follow our guide on updating the firmware via DFU Mode linked below.&#x20;
