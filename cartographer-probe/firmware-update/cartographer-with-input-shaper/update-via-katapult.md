# Update via Katapult

Your probe will come pre-flashed with Katapult (formally CanBoot), this is on both the USB, CAN and Hybrid USB/CAN Probes.&#x20;

I advise only flashing via Katapult when using a probe in CAN mode, as DFU Mode or STLink are both easier and more reliable methods for flashing USB Probes. &#x20;

### Firmware

The best place to get the probes firmware is from our  [GitHub](https://github.com/Cartographer3D/cartographer-klipper/tree/master/firmware). These have been tested thoroughly, and are known to work perfectly.&#x20;

You can also build your own firmware, our GitHub organisation has both a custom build of [Klipper](../../../) and [Katapult](https://github.com/Cartographer3D/katapult) that you can build yourself.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Untested Firmware could brick your probe - it is advisable if this is the case, you have a STLink handy in order to easily re-flash the probe.
