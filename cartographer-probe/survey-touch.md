<summary>Print Start Macro Example <mark style="color:red;">IMPORTANT</mark></summary>

Adding the `CARTOGRAPHER_TOUCH` command to your print start macro ensures that the printer performs a precise touch probe <mark style="color:red;">**AFTER**</mark> executing the `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` command and <mark style="color:red;">**AFTER**</mark> your nozzle reaches a steady 150c. This sequence helps to achieve an accurate bed leveling by accounting for any variations or offsets after the mesh calibration.

```gcode
[gcode_macro PRINT_START_EXAMPLE]
gcode:
    G28                               ; Home all axes
    M104 S{BED_TEMP}                  ; Set bed temperature
    M109 S150                         ; Wait for extuder to reach 150Â°C (intermediate step)
    M140 S{BED_TEMP}                  ; Set final bed temperature
    G28 Z                             ; Home Z axis again to account for thermal expansion
    QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL / Z_TILT_ADJUST ; Perform quad gantry leveling or Z tilt adjustmen
    G28 Z                             ; Home Z axis again to account for thermal expansion
    BED_MESH_CALIBRATE                ; Calibrate the bed mesh
    CARTOGRAPHER_TOUCH                ; Perform touch probe
    M109 S{EXTRUDER_TEMP}             ; Wait for extruder to reach target temperature

```

## Initial Calibration

{% hint style="danger" %}
Touch is best calibrated for use with a clean install. We ask you remove your existing `[scanner]` or `[cartographer]` model if you have one and any other `[scanner]` or `[cartographer]` settings from the bottom of <mark style="color:yellow;">**printer.cfg**</mark>
{% endhint %}

### Quick Calibration - Default Threshold 2500 (Good for Most)

```gcode
G28 X Y
CARTOGRAPHER_TOUCH METHOD=manual   # initiates paper test we all know and love
G28 Z
QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL / Z_TILT_ADJUST
G28 Z        
CARTOGRAPHER_TOUCH CALIBRATE=1     # starts touch test and calibration
SAVE_CONFIG                        # saves new model
```

### Threshold Test Method

```gcode
G28 X Y
CARTOGRAPHER_TOUCH METHOD=manual   # initiates paper test we all know and love
G28 Z
QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL / Z_TILT_ADJUST
G28 Z
CARTOGRAPHER_THRESHOLD_SCAN 
CARTOGRAPHER_TOUCH CALIBRATE=1     # starts touch test and calibration 
SAVE_CONFIG                        # saves model and threshold
```

## Available Commands

### `CARTOGRAPHER_TOUCH`

The `CARTOGRAPHER_TOUCH` command is designed to initiate a probing process. This will then attempt to bring the nozzle to the bed and measure this for repeatability. This ensures a perfect first layer if configured correctly.

<details>

<summary>Detailed Explanation</summary>

**Key Functions:**

* **Configuration and Initialization:**
  * The command starts by pulling various parameters either from the command itself, or falling back on default values defined in the printer's configuration (printer.cfg).
  * Parameters include speed, acceleration, retraction distances, number of samples, tolerance levels, and the specific location (X and Y coordinates) where the probing will occur.

<!---->

* **Mode Selection:**
  * The command operates in **Touch Mode**, which uses a physical touch sensor to detect contact with the surface.
  * The mode is determined by the `calibration_method` configuration in **printer.cfg**, and the command ensures that touch mode is selected.

<!---->

* **Safety and Validation Checks:**
  * Before proceeding, the command ensures that the X and Y axes are homed (i.e., the machine knows their precise positions).
  * If the axes are not homed, the command raises an error, preventing the probing process from proceeding.

<!---->

* **Probing Process:**
  * The toolhead is moved to the specified touch location (X, Y coordinates).
  * The probing process begins, collecting multiple samples to determine the exact position.
  * The process accounts for factors such as acceleration, speed, retraction distance, and retries if the tolerance levels are not met.
  * If the `manual` method is specified, a manual calibration process (paper test) is initiated instead of the automated touch process.

<!---->

* **Result Handling:**
  * Once the probing process is completed, the results (e.g., final position, standard deviation of the samples) are logged and displayed.
  * If the probing is successful, the results are used to calibrate the system, adjusting the Z-offset or other calibration parameters as needed.
  * If the probing fails, an error message is provided, and no calibration is applied.

<!---->

* **Logging and Debugging:**
  * The command supports a debug mode that logs detailed information about the probing process, including all the parameters used and the results obtained.
  * This is useful for troubleshooting and ensuring the probing process is functioning correctly.

#### Use Cases:

* **Bed Leveling:** Ensures that the print bed is perfectly level by detecting any variations in height across different points on the bed.

<!---->

* **Z-Offset Calibration:** Adjusts the Z-axis offset to ensure the nozzle is at the correct distance from the print bed for optimal printing.

<!---->

* **Probing Accuracy:** Verifies the precision and repeatability of the probing process, ensuring consistent results.

### `CARTOGRAPHER_THRESHOLD_SCAN`

The `CARTOGRAPHER_THRESHOLD_SCAN` command is used to scan a range of threshold values to find the most consistent and reliable threshold for the touch sensor. This function performs a series of probe tests across different threshold values, evaluating the consistency of each threshold until it finds the best one that meets the specified criteria.

<details>

<summary>Detailed Explanation</summary>

**Process**

1. **Threshold Scanning**
   * The scan starts by setting the trigger method to touch and initializing the current threshold to the minimum value (`MIN`).
   * The function then enters a loop where it tests each threshold value, increasing by the step size (`STEP`) until the maximum threshold (`MAX`) is reached.
2. **Threshold Qualification**
   * For each threshold value, a series of probe tests (`QUALIFY_SAMPLES`) are conducted.
   * The results are evaluated to see if they meet the acceptable range value (`RANGE_VALUE`).
3. **Threshold Verification**
   * If a threshold value shows promising consistency during qualification, it is further verified with an additional set of probe tests (`VERIFY_SAMPLES`).
   * The threshold is evaluated for quality based on the consistency of the results.
4. **Finalization**
   * If a threshold value is found that meets or exceeds the target consistency (`TARGET`), it is considered the best threshold.
   * If this threshold is different from the original, it is saved for future use.
5. **Logging Results**
   * Throughout the process, the function logs information about the testing of each threshold, including whether it passed qualification and verification.
   * At the end of the scan, the best threshold value is logged along with its quality level and range.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Available Parameters</summary>

#### **`MIN =`**

* Purpose: Defines the minimum threshold value for starting the scan.
* **Default:** 500
* **Constraints:** Must be atleast 100 and less than MAX.

#### **`MAX =`**

* Defines the maximum threshold value for ending the scan.
* **Default:** 5000
* **Constraints:** Must be greater than MIN.

#### **`STEP =`**

* Specifies the increment by which the threshold is increased during the scan.
* **Default:** 500
* **Constraints:** Must be a positive number.

#### **`SKIP =`**

* Indicates the number of initial samples to skip when evaluating thresholds.
* **Default:** 0
* **Constraints:** Must be a positive number.

#### **`QUALIFY_SAMPLES =`**

* The number of samples used to initially qualify a threshold.

### `CARTOGRAPHER_THRESHOLD_TEST`

The `CARTOGRAPHER_THRESHOLD_TEST` command is used to home using a touch sensor and check the consistency of the sensor's response. The function performs a series of probe tests at a specified threshold to determine the reliability of the sensor across multiple samples. The results are evaluated for maximum, minimum, range, average, median, and standard deviation of the probe results.

<details>

<summary>Detailed Explanation</summary>

* **Threshold Testing**
  * The test begins by setting the trigger method to 1 (touch method) and adjusting the threshold to the provided value.
  * The function then executes a series of probe tests, collecting the specified number of samples (`SAMPLES`), while skipping the specified number of initial samples (`SKIP`).
* **Probe Accuracy Check**
  * This function adjusts the probe position, performs the probe test, and measures the consistency of the results.
* **Result Evaluation**
  * The results are evaluated for:
    * Maximum value
    * Minimum value
    * Range (difference between max and min)
    * Average value
    * Median value
    * Standard deviation (sigma)
    * Number of samples within a 0.1 range
    * Number of early and late probe events
  * The quality of the threshold is then assessed based on the calculated range.
* **Finalization**
  * After the test, the threshold is restored to its original value.
  * The results are logged, and information about the test's success and the quality of the threshold is provided.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What do I need to add or change in my print start macro?

See [Print Start Macro](survey-touch.md#print-start-macro-example). But bascially, you just need to make sure your nozzle is at **maximum 150c** and then do a `CARTOGRAPHER_TOUCH` after you do a `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE`

#### I'm getting weird errors after updating my scanner.py, what do I do?

Firstly make sure you have hit the **RESTART KLIPPER** button in your Fluid/Mainsail UI, this will force the refresh of scanner.py to the updated version.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-21 210954.png" alt="" width="356"><figcaption><p>Always RESTART KLIPPER after an update.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Does touch work with glass or garolite beds?

It **CAN SOMETIMES** work depending on the thickness of your glass or garolite bed. However we can't say for certain. If its less than 2mm thick theres a good chance however we **accept no responsibility** if it **doesn't** work!&#x20;

#### Option 'X' is not valid in section 'scanner'

&#x20;You have a parameter within your `[scanner]` section in printer.cfg that isnt valid. Remove X from your printer.cfg or check its written correctly. You can see [valid parameters here](survey-touch.md#available-printer.cfg-settings)

#### Is it guaranteed that this will work on my printer?&#x20;

As with a lot of things in life, we **can't guarantee 100% compatibility**, it should be compatible with most well built printers, there are obviously some exceptions, the biggest impacting factor is the quality of the Z axis motion. If there is any binding or lack of consistency, then you may find that you will not be able to use this feature. You can still use **regular cartographer scan mode** though!

#### I was in the beta, how do I switch back to regular to continue using touch?

```bash
cd ~
sudo rm -rv Carto_TAP
cd ~/klipper/klippy/extras
sudo rm -rv scanner.py
cd ~/cartographer-klipper
git fetch
git pull
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
sudo service klipper restart
```
