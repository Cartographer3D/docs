# ðŸ”§ Assembly

There are a few different assembly options for the Cartographer probe, if you purchase the Flat Pack, you will recieve everything required to assemble for Standard, Low Profile, Right Angle installations. If you want to install on a Creality K1, or any installation with a wire extension to the coilboard, the wire is not included.&#x20;

* If you are assembling as a Standard form factor - [click here](standard.md)
* If you are assembling in a Low Profile form factor - [click here](low-profile.md)
* If you are assembling in a Right Angle form factor - Coming Soon

If you are assembling in any other way, please take note of the following:

*   The bumps for the Thermistor and Capacitor on your coil board must face down towards your printers bed.  \

*   The MCU and coil board have a polarity, the white boxes on the silk screen should align up together, Note the image below and the orientation shown. \

* If your installation moves away from any of the standard methods, please check the USB or CAN cable polarity they might need re-pinning, don't worry if you do plug it in reversed, we have reversed polarity protection, so your board should be fine.&#x20;
